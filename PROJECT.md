## 🤖 AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

### **🔄 COMPLETE BDD/TDD DEVELOPMENT CYCLE**

**🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE**: Features → Steps → Tests → Code → All Tests Pass

**📋 DEVELOPMENT PHASES**:

**Phase 1: FEATURE DEFINITION** ✅ (ALREADY COMPLETE)
- ✅ All `.feature` files written and validated
- ✅ Business requirements defined in Gherkin
- ✅ Acceptance criteria specified

**Phase 2: STEP DEFINITIONS** ✅ (ALREADY COMPLETE)
- ✅ All step definitions implemented
- ✅ 330+ BDD steps created
- ✅ All features have step definitions

**Phase 3: TEST VALIDATION** ⚠️ (CURRENT STATE)
- ⚠️ BDD tests exist but most are failing (code not implemented)
- ⚠️ Need to run tests to see specific failures
- ⚠️ This is where you start coding

**Phase 4: CODE IMPLEMENTATION** 🎯 (YOUR WORK)
- 🎯 Write Python code to make ALL BDD tests pass
- 🎯 Implement complete systems, not individual steps
- 🎯 Focus on making entire feature test suites green

**Morning (When you start)**:
1. **READ STATUS**: Look at "PROJECT STATUS TRACKING" above
2. **FIND CURRENT TASK**: Look at "CURRENT ACTIVE TASK" section
3. **SELECT SYSTEM**: Choose from Character System → World System → etc

**🚨 CRITICAL: VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT USAGE**
- **NEVER** use system pip (`pip install`) - this is managed by the OS
- **ALWAYS** use virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- **ALWAYS** install with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **NEVER** use `--break-system-packages` - this breaks system dependencies
- **ALWAYS** check you're in venv: `which python` should show `./venv/bin/python`
- **IF IN DOUBT**: `deactivate` then `source venv/bin/activate`

**SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION CYCLE**:
1. **📁 READ FEATURE**: `features/[system_name].feature` → Understand requirements
2. **📝 STUDY STEPS**: `features/steps/[system_name]_steps.py` → See expected interfaces
3. **🧪 RUN TESTS**: `behave features/[system_name].feature` → See what's failing
4. **💻 IMPLEMENT CODE**: Create `core/systems/[system_name].py` to pass ALL tests
5. **🧪 ADD UNIT TESTS**: Write comprehensive unit tests with >90% coverage
6. **🔍 ADD HYPOTHESIS**: Add property-based tests for complex logic (if applicable)
7. **🎭 ADD E2E TESTS**: Write end-to-end tests (where makes sense for system)
8. **📏 RUN PYLINT**: Achieve 10/10 score on implementation
9. **🔄 ITERATE**: Fix all failures, rerun all tests, until EVERYTHING passes
10. **🧹 CLEANUP**: Remove any obsolete/unnecessary files
11. **✅ VERIFY COMPLETE**: BDD + Unit + E2E + Coverage + Pylint all pass
12. **🔄 COMMIT**: `git commit` and `push` completed system
13. **⏸️ UPDATE**: Check off system when ALL quality gates pass

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
```bash
# BDD Tests
behave features/[system_name].feature
# Expected: 1 feature passed, X steps passed, 0 steps failed, 0 steps undefined

# Unit Tests + Coverage
pytest --cov=core/systems/[system_name] --cov-report=term-missing
# Expected: >90% coverage, 0 failures

## 🤖 LLM Agent Optimized BDD/TDD Flow

### Phase-Based Development Strategy

#### **Phase Entry Requirements**
1. **BDD Analysis**: Review feature scenarios and step definitions
2. **Dependency Check**: Verify all prerequisites are implemented
3. **Interface Design**: Define class interfaces based on step definitions
4. **Test Data**: Create test fixtures and mock data

#### **Implementation Flow**

**Step 1: BDD-First Design**
```python
# Analyze Given/When/Then steps
@given('the player has created a character')
def step_player_created(context):
    # This tells us we need a Character class
    # with create_character() method
```

**Step 2: Interface Definition**
```python
# Define required interfaces based on BDD steps
class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name: str = ""
        self.class_type: str = ""
        self.level: int = 1
        self.stats: Dict[str, int] = {}
        self.inventory: List[Item] = []

    def create_character(self, name: str, class_type: str) -> bool:
        pass
```

**Step 3: TDD Implementation**
```python
# Write failing tests first
def test_character_creation():
    char = Character()
    result = char.create_character("TestPlayer", "Warrior")
    assert result == True
    assert char.name == "TestPlayer"
    assert char.class_type == "Warrior"

# Then implement to pass tests
def create_character(self, name: str, class_type: str) -> bool:
    # Implementation
```

**Step 4: BDD Integration**
```python
# Update BDD steps to use real implementation
@given('the player has created a character')
def step_player_created(context):
    context.player = Character()
    context.player.create_character("TestCharacter", "Warrior")
```

#### **LLM Agent Development Guidelines**

**1. Atomic Development**
- Focus on one step definition at a time
- Implement minimal viable functionality
- Ensure each step passes independently

**2. Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with basic functionality
- Add complexity incrementally
- Maintain backward compatibility

**3. Test-Driven Validation**
- Write tests before implementation
- Validate against BDD scenarios
- Ensure statistical requirements are met

**4. Interface Consistency**
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Follow established patterns from previous systems
- Document interfaces clearly

#### **Error Handling Strategy**

**Expected vs Unexpected Errors**
```python
# Expected game events
def create_character(self, name: str, class_type: str) -> bool:
    if class_type not in VALID_CLASSES:
        return False  # Expected failure

    # Unexpected errors should raise exceptions
    if not isinstance(name, str):
        raise ValueError("Name must be a string")
```

**Graceful Degradation**
- Implement fallback behaviors
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Maintain game state consistency

#### **Performance Considerations**

**LLM-Friendly Patterns**
```python
# Avoid complex inheritance chains
class Character:  # Simple, flat structure
    pass

# Use composition over inheritance
class Equipment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weapon = Weapon()
        self.armor = Armor()

# Clear, explicit interfaces
def calculate_damage(self, attacker: Character, defender: Character) -> int:
    # Straightforward calculation, no magic
    base_damage = attacker.stats.strength
    defense = defender.stats.defense
    return max(1, base_damage - defense)
```

#### **Validation Strategy**

**BDD Validation**
```python
# Statistical validation requirements
def test_dda_algorithm(self):
    # Test the specific formula from BDD
    new_difficulty = base_difficulty * (0.7 + 0.3 * (target_performance / measured_performance))
    assert abs(new_difficulty - current_difficulty) <= (base_difficulty * 0.15)
```

**Property-Based Testing**
```python
# Use hypothesis for edge cases
@given(st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=20), st.sampled_from(VALID_CLASSES))
def test_character_level_scaling(self, level, class_type):
    char = Character()
    char.create_character("Test", class_type)
    char.level = level

    # Validate level scaling properties
    assert char.stats.health > 0
    assert char.stats.strength >= 0
```

## **ACTIVE BACKLOG & TECHNICAL DEBT**

### **🚨 IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS (Must Complete for 100% Test Success)**

#### **Shop System Test Failures (17/35 passing - 46%)**
- **Priority 1**: 18 remaining test failures blocking production readiness
- **Missing Methods**: `process_transaction`, `calculate_buy_price`, trading mechanics
- **Data Model Issues**: ShopItem.stock property, ShopEconomy.gold_reserve alias
- **Economic Simulation**: Supply/demand pricing, reputation systems, bulk discounts
- **Integration Tests**: Character/Shop/Item/Economy system integration

#### **Pydantic V2 Migration (Critical Technical Debt)**
- **Status**: In Progress - Character models partially migrated
- **Remaining Classes**: Item, Enemy, Quest, Location, GameState models
- **Pattern Migration**:
  - `class Config` → `model_config = ConfigDict()`
  - `@validator` → `@field_validator`
  - `values` parameter → `info.data` in validators
